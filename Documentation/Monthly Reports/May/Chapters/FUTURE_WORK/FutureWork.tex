\label{sec:futureWork}
In addition to the Lattice Boltzmann Solver and Visualization integration, we have identified several future work opportunities:

\begin{description}
\item[Octrees]
Vertex identification as part of a simulated muscle will be efficient by means of a specialized data structure. We will begin integrating the Point Cloud Library (PCL) to our rendering engine to make use of its parallel octree implementation.
\item[Level of Detail]
As computational resources become scarce due to real-time simulation and rendering requirements, implementation of a Level of Detail technique will improve hardware performance.
\item[Clipping]
Sections of a virtual extended arm will be useful to calculate intermuscular space from different poses, as an extension of the muscular simulation.
\item[Simulation control]
LBM simulations require fine tuning of viscosity and grid size parameters. Future work will extend the user interface to facilitate parameter adjustment in real-time.
\item[Fiber generation]
\item[Bidomain simulation]
\item[Inter mesh Collision]
\item[Muscle-Bone Hierarchy]
